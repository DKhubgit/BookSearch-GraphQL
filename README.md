## Description

Given a working web application with RESTful based API, this application was refactored using Apollo server and GraphQL. This projects implements a different API functionality with new concepts such as typeDefs, resolvers, apollo express server, and JSON Web Token. The goal of this project was to keep the original functionality intact while bringing in those new concepts. The app's function is to give users the option to save or delete a book found through the search bar. The search bars utilizes the Google books API to request numerous books based on the search input. Lastly, users must log in to save books and view those books.
